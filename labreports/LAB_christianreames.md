# Step 2: Evaluate Online Job Search Sites

## 2.1 Summary
| Site | Score | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| Indeed | 16 | Overall, Indeed was very easy to use and was complex enough to give people as much description as possible but in a concise way to where it wasn't overcomplicated. However, the skills test could be considered a loss in value of time which is one thing that could potentially be corrected. Other than that, the site is easy to use and user-friendly.  |
| ZipRecruiter | 17 | I was extremely shocked at how seamless it was to use this site. I loved how in the dashboard it labeled jobs in different categories like previous jobs and make it easy to know what jobs were in which category. Also, it was basically a two-click application process which is very smooth and seamless. They could add some more description at certain parts like showing what the employer would see on the application before submitting, but even then it's still very seamless and gives enough information in my personal opinion. |

## 2.2 Site 1: Indeed

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | The site was very intuitive. I enjoyed how easy it was to navigate overall and I didn't really have any issues. The only thing that kind of was annoying was the skills tests that you had to take but that isn't anything crazy as it's importnant that the company knows your abilites. 
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 2 | I only give this a two because of the skills test. While I think that it brings value and makes sense why the skill tests are there, I do believe that it takes up more time to fill out. I think that it could benefit from not having to take tests because applications could be filled out quicker. 
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? |   2 | This website made it very simple to complete applications. However, the information that was given could be interpreted differently and could cause frustration amongst applicants. For example, if you don't have a specific skill listed, the website will stop you and make sure that you still want to apply without that particular skill added on your resume, which I thought was interesting. While this is good at making sure applicants have the necessary information needed, I can see it causing some distress to people which can be frustrating.|
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 2 | This site did a good job of recommending different jobs based off my past jobs and current searches which I thought was great. However, I preferred how ziprecuiter separated what it categorized jobs by which I thought was better than the way Indeed does it.  |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy?  | 2 | The site really wasn't that careful as it copied and pasted my resume with no issues. 
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3 | The workflow was very effective. I saw no issues with my ability to get to my profile and various job applications and it's very simple/user friendly. |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2 | It would probably take a while to use with a mouseless interface. But, it's not the worst platform I've used with no mouse.    |
| **TOTAL** | 16  |   |

## 2.3 Site 2: Ziprecruiter

| Category | Grade (0-3) | Comments / Justification |
|---|---|---|
| 1. **Don't make me think:** How intuitive was this site? | 3 | This site was way more intuitive that I thought it was gonna be. It really didn't take much effort to set my account up and it streamlined the process greatly.   |
| 2. **Users are busy:** Did this site value your time?  | 3 | This site absolutely valued my time. The way that it broke down the jobs by different categories like past jobs made it easy to find what I was looking for. It really only took one or two clicks to apply for a job as well which was nice. Overall, very quick and efficient. |
| 3. **Good billboard design:** Did this site make the important steps and information clear? How or how not? | 2 | This is somewhat of a grey area for me especially when compared to indeed. I think that Indeed is a little more descriptive but ZipRecuiter made the process streamlined. With that being said, ZipRecruiter doesn't go as in-depth as some of the other websites I tried. That's why it gets a two. 
| 4. **Tell me what to do:** Did this site lead you towards a specific, opinionated path? | 3  | The website not only takes you to a path but makes that path short so it's easier to navigate. I liked how the application was nearly one-click.   |
| 5. **Omit Words:** How careful was this site with its use of copy? | 1  | It really wasn't that careful. Once I clicked apply, my application was submitted which could prove questionable to some people who'd want to see what's showed to an employer.  |
| 6. **Navigation:** How effective was the workflow / navigation of the site? | 3  |  Extremely easy to use and navigate. The applications are easy to fill out and it's simple to get to various aspects of the site.  |
| 7. **Accessibility:** How accessible is this site to a screen reader or a mouse-less interface? | 2  | I think it would be easier than Indeed, but it still wouldn't be as seamless as it could be with a mouse.  |
| **TOTAL** | 17 |   |


# Step 3 Competitive Usability Test

## Step 3.1 Product Use Case

| Use Case #1 | TrueBill's push notifications
|---|---|
| Title |Notify the user when their newest statement from last month is available.|
| Description / Steps |An organization would take the statement of what's paid from the data that they've gathered and notify the user via push notification on their phone. |
| Primary Actor |TrueBill looking to help their users be aware of what they're spendingßß.|
| Preconditions |The user has to be paying a subscription to something or have paid in the past.|
| Postconditions |The system would notify the user that their statement was ready to go.|

## Step 3.2 Identifier a competitive product

List of Competitors

Competitor 1: [TrueBill](https://www.truebill.com)


## Step 3.3 Write a Useability Test

| Step | Tasks | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Logging in or creating your account  | Create a new TrueBill account or log in to one that you've already made. |
| 2 | Check your recurring costs of subscription  | Check the tab on the dashboard that says "recurring".   |
| 3 | Check the cost of what you're spending  | Find the tab on the dashboard that says "spendings".  |


## Step 3.4 Observe User Interactions

| Step | Tasks | Observations |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create account/Log in | Creating an account really wasn't overly complicated. All it asked for was basic information and they even had an option where you could set up a free account without needing the premium service that they offer.  |
| 2 | Check your recurring costs of subscription  | It was easy to find the tab and you could even pick between viewing all of your costs and the ones that are upcoming.  |
| 3 | Check spending costs  | This was just as easy as it was to find recurring costs. It showed a monthly breakdown as well as the past few months of what was spent.  |


## Step 3.5 Findings
Organize your findings here.
Pros:
- The account is easy to create.
- The recurring tab is easy to understand when it breaks everything down as well as gives the user options on what they want to do with their subscriptions. 
- The spending tab gives great information as it breaks everything down on what the user spent. 
Cons:
- No explanation of premium vs free when you make your account with them. It would benefit them to explain to a user what is offered in comparison to the free. 
- The dashboard graph could be simpler in some ways. 
Overall:
- Overall, TrueBill's platform is easy to use and gives good in-depth breakdowns that can help people save more money and cut out what they don't want or don't use.
